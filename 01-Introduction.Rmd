# Introduction. Data Analytics in football

The digital revolution is currently one of the most significant
challenges of our time, altering numerous aspects of society. Football,
in particular, has also been influenced by this transformation.
Technological advancements and digitalization have resulted in a swift
upsurge in the number of measuring devices, data collection and volumes
of data. The leading data companies worldwide, including IBM, Intel, SAP
and Microsoft, are vying for superior data analytics tools and
leveraging sports as an example domain to showcase their products and
brand power [@1].

The practice of data analytics in football has a long history, dating
back to the post-World War II era, when data collection and analysis was
undertaken manually using pencil and paper [@1]. It wasn't until
Moneyball was published in 2003 that significant progress began to
emerge: The book, \"The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\" introduced
sports analytics to a broader audience. It illustrated the use of data
analytics in identifying undervalued players and constructing a
successful team. Since then, data analytics has become an integral
component of sport, football inclusive [@1].

One of the best examples of data analytics being applied to sports is
basketball. Teams use data to analyze player performance, identify
strengths and weaknesses, and develop strategies to win games [@2]. They
use in-memory analytics, visualization, the cloud, mobility, camera
footage, and sensors to transform their game. This performance analyses
are of vital importance to a team, aiming to reduce expenditure, enhance
team worth and refine processes across all levels and segments of
operations. The German Football Association (DFB) and the National
Basketball Association (NBA) are two unique cases of digital
transformation from the sports world. Successful teams turn player
performance data into action and gain a competitive advantage.

Over the last years, football analytics has gained significant
popularity, aiming to delve deeper into the game by utilizing advanced
data analysis techniques to optimize team and player performance. This
chapter examines the various areas of football where data can be used
for analysis, alongside the commonly found data types within this
