# Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}
The master thesis explores the application of data analytics in football, with a focus on enhancing understanding and performance through a data driven approach. The study reviews the history and evolution of data analytics in sports, particularly football, and introduces a new methodology for quantifying the effectiveness of offside strategies using Pitch Control models, *Offside Control*. We analize 1,251,934 frames from 100 matches to characterize the Offside Control of 442 players. The methodology combines physical metrics and tactical models derived from tracking datasets, offering insights into the tactical nuances of successful offside strategies. The project's data processing and modeling are conducted using Python, with the source code available in a GitHub repository[^1]. 


# Dedication {#dedication .unnumbered}

To Prof. J.M. Buldú, whose trust and belief in my abilities opened doors I could never have imagined.

To my dearest friends and family, for always trusting and believing in me much more than I do.


And to Prof. J.M. Marín, whose dedication and guidance illuminated the path of this thesis. The thesis felt lighter under the laughs we had in the way.

With sincere gratitude,
