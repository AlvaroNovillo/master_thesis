# Appendix 

In Table \@ref(tab:ranking-tab), we have gathered the Effective Offside Control, along with the efficiency percentage for each of the teams represented in Fig. \@ref(fig:ranking), in descending ranking order

```{r ranking-tab, echo=FALSE}
ranking_oc <- read.csv("~/TFM_ANC_2024/TFM_ANC_2024/master_thesis/data_samples/ranking_oc.txt")

colnames(ranking_oc) <- c("Ranking", "Effective OC", "Efficiency (%)")

ranking_oc %>%
  kbl(booktabs = T, caption = "Average Effective Offside Control values and Efficiency for each team from the Spanish national league (LaLiga Santander) during the season 2019/2020, ordered by their ranking") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down","hold_position"), position = "center")



```
