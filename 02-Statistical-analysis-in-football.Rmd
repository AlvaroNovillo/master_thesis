# Statistical analysis in football

When discussing sports analytics in football, the first metric that
often springs to mind is the Expected Goals (xG) ratio. This statistical
indicator is a predictive Machine Learning (ML) model used to assess the
likelihood of scoring for every shot made in the game. In the context of
each shot, the xG model computes the scoring probability, leveraging a
set of event parameters.

Wyscout xG model, for example, encompass the shot's spatial coordinates,
the assisting player's position, the striking player's use of foot or
head, the type of assist involved, the occurrence of a dribble by either
a field player or the goalkeeper immediately preceding the shot, whether
the shot arises from a set piece, whether it transpires during a
counterattack or in a transitional phase of play, and the subjective
assessment of shot danger as determined by a designated tagger. The
amalgamation of these parameters serves as the foundation for training
the xG model using historical Wyscout data, culminating in the
prediction of the likelihood of a given shot resulting in a goal
[@wyscout].

The probabilities range from 0 to 1. Thus, a shot with an xG value of
0.1 has a 10% chance of being scored. Penalties have a fixed xG value of
0.76.

visual representation of the cumulative development of expected goals
(xG) during the Eibar - Malaga match, which took place on January 15th,
2023 in Spain's second division. Each data point on the graph
corresponds to a shot made by both teams over the course of the game,
offering a comprehensive overview of the evolving scoring opportunities
and outcomes throughout the duration of the game.
