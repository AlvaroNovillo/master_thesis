abstract = {Given the recent trend in Data Science (DS) and Sports Analytics, an opportunity has arisen for utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) techniques in sports. This paper reviews background and advanced basketball metrics used in National Basketball Association (NBA) and Euroleague games. The purpose of this paper is to benchmark existing performance analytics used in the literature for evaluating teams and players. Basketball is a sport that requires full set enumeration of parameters in order to understand the game in depth and analyze the strategy and decisions by minimizing unpredictability. This research provides valuable information for team and player performance basketball analytics to be used for better understanding of the game. Furthermore, these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions. Hence, critical analysis of these metrics are valuable tools for domain experts and decision makers to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the game, to better evaluate opponent teams, to see how to optimize performance indicators, to use them for team and player forecasting and finally to make better choices for team composition.}

abstract = {We investigate how similar heatmaps of soccer players are when constructed from (i) event datasets and (ii) tracking datasets. When using event datasets, we show that the scale at which the events are grouped strongly influences the correlation with the tracking heatmaps. Furthermore, there is an optimal scale at which the correlation between event and tracking heatmaps is the highest. However, even at the optimal scale, correlations between both approaches are moderate. Furthermore, there is high heterogeneity in the players’ correlation, ranging from negative values to correlations close to the unity. We show that the number of events performed by a player does not crucially determine the level of correlation between both heatmaps. Finally, we analysed the influence of the player position, showing that defenders are the players with the highest correlations while forwards have the lowest.}

abstract = {In this paper, we define a novel methodology for analyzing soccer matches and teams using spatial multilayer networks. Departing from a segmentation of the pitch into h×v regions, we create 2-layer networks that capture the exchange of ball possessions between teams throughout a match. To assess the significance of each node, we employed eigenvector centrality measures within the constructed multilayer network. Furthermore, we introduce three additional metrics, namely the leakage, recovery and switching factor, which quantify the possession transitions between layers. Finally, we apply our methodology to analyze the performance of Spanish soccer teams over an entire season, using the aforementioned multilayer parameters, and discuss the relation with the playing style and ranking of soccer teams.}
